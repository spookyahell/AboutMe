# AboutMe / FAQ
This is a bit about me, since a really good way of having a bio on Github is missing, this is a repo with that effect

# What do I do all day normally?
Getting ready for a job in real life, aka. a work/study combo

# My life motto

#KeepItSimple #KeepItReal #KeepItFun

# What programming languages am I experienced in?
I do most of my work in (and therefore know it quite a bit):

- Python (version 3.6 and up)

I know a little about

- Delphi (used to work with it a lot)
- HTML

I know the very basics of (really don't expect much from me here)

- cmd/batch
- JS (IDK why I'm even mentioning it here, barely know anything about it)


# What do I progam?

It depends, whatever I'm up for... though it usually has something to do with some webservice... or music... or tv... 

# TV shows

I'm 19 years old now and I admit: Most of my tv shows up until recently are kids shows and I still like SOME of them...
<br />Most animated stuff from that genre I don't really enjoy though (anymore)

I enjoy(ed) watching following tv shows:

- **The Big Bang Theory** (liked a lot of season, but now... come on @WB, END IT already!, I know season 12 is the last one but for me could have ended at the latest after season 12)
- **2 Broke Girls** (season 1-2 maybe, anything else just kept going downhill if you ask me)
- **The Odd Couple** (2015; Never really saw the original but I loved the 2015 version so much I don't want to spoil it)
- **Greenhouse Academy** (2 seasons watched when arrived; @Netflix sucks for making shows so short though)
- **Maggie & Bianca** - Fashion Friends (still like it; watched all 3 seasons)
- **Soy Luna** (still like it; just finished season 3 which was very weired at the end)
- **Violetta** (still like it; but haven't really watched it in a fairly long time)
- **Billy & Billie** (2015; just finished watching it; wow the used the f-word there a lot ðŸ˜‚ - almost like the writers where like "We need it at least 10x per minute, where can we squeeze in another one)
- **Modern Family** (currently at the beginning of season 5; loving every scene of it so far)
- **New Girl** (adored all 7 seasons)
- **Supergirl** (funny story with it being on CBS first... CW was better from the start but season 1 was so great... IDK how they did it)
- **The Flash** (started watching it on a tiny 4:3-screen on my phone once and fell in love with it right away... still love it)
- **Spongebob** (now this is one from the past for me... probably been more than 5 years since I've watched more than 5min videos from it on YouTube)


I also enjoy two major talk shows:

- **The Daily Show with Trevor Noah** (I watched every show since 2016 at least; I love #BehindTheScenes, and also Trevor Noah himself*)
- **The Late Show with Stephen Colbert** (I watch every show and for the history I'm working my way up their entire youtube uploads)

*might be interesting to know that I like that show so much I was there for a live-taping and you where actually able to see me as part of the audience in one of the episodes

# Standpoints

- Politically I am a democrat. I am not active in any parties but I do believe in the right to vote and believe it is important we make use of it.
- I do not like the capitalism going on these days... it's downright cruel.
- I do not like the way human kind treats mother nature. (though I admit not being 100% perfectly respectful either - so when I say "shame on all of us" I'm also talking about me)
- I dislike everybody who undermines democracy: Including the american a..hole, the russian dumb-a, and the north korean bowl of stupidity. (the list is incomplete ofc)
- I like people who manage to make fun of idiots, like the guy who but [g-20.in](http://g-20.in)
- I like to eat unhealthy. I won't beat around the bush. My doctor once told me I don't need to come back before I loose 5 kilograms. I'm pretty sure I have gained weight since.
- Law: I love it, but it sucks in many ways, there are so many loopholes for so many things. And maybe they could update the dictionary of the law... so that people can actually understand it. There's an idea..
- Nothing is for free, so you gotta look out for sb. giving away free money (with no conditions) and try to get it. (Actually this is a dream of mine)
- Free Time is the best time of the day :)
- Microsoft is cool and sucks at the same time ... LOL and no I do not want to discuss that.
- Github is now part of Microsoft so... same for Github :)


# FAQ

## Will we ever see a real profile picture of you?
No I have no such plans. Though I do write some personal info here I believe in staying anonymous as a person. Nothing you read here should be making it easy for you to find me in real life.

## Do you frequently update your repos?
No, normally I actually do not. It is quite possible that privately I already have a better version of something you're seeing here... and I have just been to lazy to update it. Though I will update stuff sometimes. It's not like I'm dead or sth... Best thing is just do sit and wait ... but if you really need a feature or sth. I will be happy to look at it when I find the time after you filed an issue or commented...
FYI, privately I also have a shit-ton of scripts (python) that I don't publish (and some don't intend to for different reasons)


## Any big plans for the future?
Wow, you really ask the good questions... 

I recently started working on a client for 1fichier... it might me the biggest thing I've ever done, because it also might be my first pypi-project... looking forward to working on that in 2019

## What do we do if we want to know something personal that you didn't write here?

WOW, okay, let's see... we are on Github, so comments are a thing. Catching where I'm going with this? Good. 'Cause I am not. ðŸ˜‚
